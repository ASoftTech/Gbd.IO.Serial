# Todo Notes

## General

  * Consider Gbd.IO.Serial.Compat library for supporting the old API
  * Once the lower level API is working consider looking into a Reactive Extensions layer on top for Rx / Tx of data

  * Check removal of serial port when usb lead is disconnected
    We may be able to use info from the ManagementObjectSearcher / SerialInfo class

  * Check for Ring pin support, and additional speeds for the baud rate
  * Check / test the buffer code

## Vagrant

  * Look into using Vagrant to generate a VirtualBox VM Image for testing the linux implementation.
  * Look into using Virtualbox's seamless mode and remote debugging with Visual Studio

## Testing

  * Check the output from XUnit Tests to console / Test Output window
  * Code up all tests

## Examples

  * Code up Examples, maybe using GtkSharp and ASP .Net Core Console / Web apps

## Documentation

  * Finish up Docs
